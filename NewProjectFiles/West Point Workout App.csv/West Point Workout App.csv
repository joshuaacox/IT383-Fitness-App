"2019/04/08 10:47:24 AM AST","I like the equipment locator on the website. It can be really useful, but i suggest putting dumbbell ranges for each room.","5","The color scheme is fine. It sort of plain but makes the website easy to read.","4","You can add the some variety to the workouts"
"2019/04/09 10:06:00 PM AST","I don't like the descriptions for where the equipment is located","5","Less bold colors like yellow, more cool calm colors like blue","5","Use a map to show where equipment location is."
"2019/04/09 10:12:51 PM AST","Couldn't tell what the muscles were based on the pictures, maybe add captions or space in between the pictures for better clarity","5","Yes!!","4","captions to pictures, description of purpose of the website or short guide to it"
"2019/04/09 11:19:21 PM AST","I like that it tells me where the bench presses are!","5","Nope. Not big into gold.","4","I think it could help you find other people who are working the same muscle groups as you. That way, if I would like to work on my bench press (but I DON'T have anyone to spot me!) I can find someone who is also working on bench press. Then, we can become ""workout buddies""."
